Welcome to the official manual for the TexEdit editor *(not to be confused with TextEdit, which is unrelated)*.


What is TexEdit?
----------------

TexEdit is a **simple, portable text editor** for writing `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_ documents alongside a live preview of the
resulting PDF, written in C++ and Rust.

This project is *very* work-in-progress and developed in my free time, so keep that in mind if you decide to use it! Platform support is currently
limited to Linux and macOS; Windows support may be implemented in the future, since it is a relatively big task in this case. Despite being a
personal project, TexEdit is still of course open-source and contributions are welcome and encouraged (if this applies to you, see the
:doc:`guidance page <content/contributors>`.)

Source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/kosude/texedit>`_.
